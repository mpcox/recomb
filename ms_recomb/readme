Full instructions on how to use most functions in ms_recomb are available in the original ms documentation:

This code variant, ms_recomb, allows you to change recombination rates over time, but only for a single population.  

*Do not use this code to model multiple populations and changing recombination at the same time. The changing recombination function is not expected to behave correctly in this scenario.*

To compile type:  gcc -O3 -o ms_recomb ms_recomb.c streec.c rand1.c -lm

Example usage:

ms_recomb 5 2 -t 6.0 -r 1.0 1000 -eR 0.5 3.0 > ms_recomb.out
   
which would change the recombination parameter from 1.0 to 3.0 at time 0.5.

For more detailed descriptions of these time and recombination rate parameters, see the original ms documentation.
