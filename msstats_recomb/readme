Full instructions on how to use most functions in msstats_recomb are available in the original msstats documentation:

This code variant, msstats_recomb, calculates n-tuples and specifically focuses on summaries of recombination, including a new summary statistic, min(d).

For more detailed descriptions of these summary statistics, see the original msstats documentation.

This code requires a working version of the libsequence library:

https://molpopgen.github.io/libsequence/

To compile type:  g++ -O3 -o msstats_recomb msstats_recomb.cc -lsequence

Example usage:

To calculate recombination summaries on entire ms datasets (i.e., no n-tuple subsampling)

ms_recomb 5 2 -t 6.0 -r 1.0 1000 -eR 0.5 3.0 | msstats_recomb

To calculate recombination summaries on 5 n-tuples of size 4:

ms_recomb 5 1 -t 6.0 -r 1.0 1000 -eR 0.5 3.0 | msstats_recomb -q 4 -p 5

When calculating summaries on n-tuples, it is best practice to feed only a single ms_recomb dataset to msstats_recomb.  If multiple datasets are provided, the first p lines contain n-tuple permutations of the first dataset, the second p lines contain n-tuple permutations of the second dataset, and so forth.
